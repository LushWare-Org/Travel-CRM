# Service-to-service invoker grants (deliberately NOT the gateway identity).

# no gateway hop, by design, so no public rate limiter and no server-to-self
# ingress (docs/designs/management-context-copilot.md §"Adapters"). It forwards
# the original caller's x-user-* headers, so lead-service's own ownership and
# role checks still decide access; this grant only lets the call reach the
# container at all. Cloud Run rejects an unauthenticated call at the platform
# edge with a 403 before the app runs, so the caller must also present an ID
# token for this service's URL — minted in
# Services/assistant-service/src/utils/cloudRunAuth.js.

# ── Remaining page adapters ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every page key the copilot serves needs BOTH the internal URL on
# assistant-service (cloud_run.tf) and a run.invoker grant here. Domain services
# run with allow_unauthenticated = false, so a missing grant is not a 403 the
# app can explain — Cloud Run rejects the call at the platform edge before the
# container starts, and the page renders as "source unavailable".
#
# assistant_invoker_user is the one that matters most: USER_SERVICE_URL has been
# set on assistant-service since the public assistant shipped, but no grant was
# ever added, so that call could not have succeeded in a deployed environment.
# The settings page reads it directly, and so does the policy-document path.
#
# These are written out individually rather than as a for_each map on purpose:
# converting the existing gateway_invoker_* resources would change their state
# addresses, and rewriting live IAM bindings for tidiness is not worth the risk.
# A future change can consolidate the whole family once nothing is mid-deploy.
