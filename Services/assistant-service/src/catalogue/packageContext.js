// answered from whatever policy section happened to share a word with it. This
// module is the read that fixes that, and it is deliberately the ONLY place the
// public turn touches package data.
//
// Two shapes travel from here into a turn:
//
//   the catalogue      every published package, a bounded page of them, so the
//                      model can answer prices, compare, and pick one
//   the detail         inclusions and the day-by-day outline, fetched for one
//                      package the visitor actually named
//
// The detail fetch is deliberately narrow. `getPackageById` increments the
// package's view counter on every read, so pulling detail for the catalogue
// would count a view for every package every time anyone said hello.
