// Capability follows the QUESTION and the ACTOR, not the page the operator
// happens to be standing on.
//
// What this replaced: `adapter.askTools(scope)` returned a page's tool list, so
// the same operator asking the same question got different capability depending on
// which screen they were on. A question spanning two domains was unanswerable from
// either. The page still decides what is VOLUNTEERED without being asked (that is
// what keeps the panel quiet); it no longer decides what may be ASKED.
//
// The map itself lives in `@travel-crm/contracts` next to the wire enums, and it
// mirrors the guard on the target route. Being narrower than the route is safe:
// a tool absent from an actor's vocabulary is a visible absence, never a 403
// halfway through an answer. The domain service's own checks still run under the
// caller's forwarded identity.

// capability line below without anything saying so.
// Deliberately coarse SUBJECTS rather than one label per tool: several tools read
// the same thing, and `capabilitySummary` dedupes, so the limitation sentence stays
// a readable list ("company performance, invoices, leads and packages") instead of
// enumerating nine tool names at an operator who just wanted an answer.
