/**
 * crm_assistant — the copilot's transcript, telemetry, per-actor read state and
 * the insight-suppression log.
 *
 * Every table here is deleted for the scope this seed owns and rewritten on
 * every run — including AssistantSession, ManagementLastSeen and InsightState,
 * whose compound unique keys would otherwise make a rewrite collide with the
 * deterministic id an earlier run already used. The reset helper in
 * lib/reset.mjs only understands id prefixes, so every id this module mints
 * must carry its category prefix — the message ids
 * additionally start with the session id so a session-scoped delete catches
 * them even when the category prefix differs.
 *
 * The conversation data is the fixture transcripts plus a handful of short,
 * plausible exchanges for the panels that need history but have no design
 * copy of their own (a billing question, a package query, a group booking).
