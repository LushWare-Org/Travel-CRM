### Add a New Stat Card

  icon={IconComponent}
  label="Metric Label"
  value="123"
  trend="+5%"
  trendDirection="up" // or "down" or "neutral"
  unit="USD" // optional
  color="blue" // blue, green, purple, orange, red, pink
/>

  {/* Your chart component here */}
</ChartContainer>
```

### Change Time Range (Phase 2)
When you connect the backend, use the `timeRange` state:
```jsx
const [timeRange, setTimeRange] = useState("monthly");
// Then use this to fetch data: `/api/analytics/leads?period=${timeRange}`
```
