# Landing is a standalone marketing page with no backend; its only build-time
# inputs are the two portal URLs it links out to (src/config/portals.js).
# Those default to the production custom domains, so every non-prod deploy has
# to pass the matching environment's URLs explicitly -- otherwise a dev deploy
# would hand visitors off to production portals (or to domains that do not
# exist yet) while looking perfectly healthy.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deploy-landing.sh [dev|staging|prod]
#
# Override either URL by exporting VITE_MANAGEMENT_URL / VITE_CLIENT_URL.
